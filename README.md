### PROJECT OVERVIEW
                           
    This project (Project Analysis) aims to provide insight on how data collected can be analysed,using microsoft excel and its functions.This project also make provision for easy access of data for compilation of data with the use of shortcuts.
    
### FOUNDATION OF DATA AND TOOLS USED
Data is the collection of facts,events and statistical informations used for decision making.
Data Analysis involves inspecting,cleansing,transforming and modelling data to discover useful information,draw conclusion and support decision making 
### TOOLS USED
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
   - For Data Cleaning
   - For Analysing
   - For Data Visualization
- SQL-Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- Github for portfolio Building

 ### Data source
 The primary source od data used here is Data sale.csv and this is an open source data that can be freeely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or FRED or any other repository site.
 ### DATA STORAGE AND STRUCTURE
 All data needs to be stored.It can be stored on Excel (premises) or Cloud (internet),cassandra.
 ### DATA STRUCURE
 There are three differents ways data can be structured 
  - Structured: Tabular Format
  - Semi-structured data:not in tabular format,they appear in pairs
  - Unstructured data it comes in media files,videos,audios. 
  ### DATA ANALYSIS LIFE CYCLE
Integration- Transformation - Modelling - visualization - Analysis - Presentation
### SQL-STRUCTURE QUERY LANGUAGE
SQL allow usuers to query the database in a number of ways using english-like statement.It enable users to relate databases and tables.
